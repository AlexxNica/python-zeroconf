This is Multicast DNS Service Discovery for Python v0.12-wmcbrine
Originally by Paul Scott-Murphy, modified by William McBrine.

Zeroconf.py is the implementation file, look at the end for examples of
basic use.  You can also view Browser.py to see how to browse for services.

This fork is used in all of my TiVo-related projects: HME for Python 
(and therefore HME/VLC), Network Remote, and pyTivo. Until now, I was 
tracking the changes for Zeroconf.py in three separate repos. I figured 
I should have an authoritative source.

Although I make changes based on my experience with TiVos, I expect that 
they're generally applicable. This version also includes patches found 
on the now-defunct (?) Launchpad repo of pyzeroconf, and elsewhere 
around the net -- not always well-documented, sorry.

Long-term goals: Python 3.x
